# 🚀 Fast & Fuel Systems Analysis

This project was developed as part of my Systems Analysis coursework, showcasing the practical application of system design and analysis techniques. The goal was to thoroughly analyze system requirements, design a robust system architecture, and deliver a tailored solution that addresses specific user needs. The focus was on leveraging industry-standard modeling methodologies to create a functional prototype.

📋 Project Objective
The objective of this project was to design an efficient and scalable system for managing fuel station operations, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing user experience. By applying Systems Analysis principles, we identified key pain points and developed a solution that streamlines processes, reduces costs, and improves service delivery.

🔍 Analysis & Design Approach
We utilized a comprehensive approach to Systems Analysis, including:

- Requirements Gathering: Conducted interviews and surveys to capture user needs and system requirements.
- Modeling Techniques: Created UML diagrams (use case, class, and sequence diagrams) to visualize system interactions and workflows.
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD): Designed data models to represent system entities and their relationships.
- Prototyping: Developed a functional prototype to validate system requirements and design choices.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- UML Tools: For modeling system architecture and interactions.
- Draw.io: To design clear and precise ERDs and UML diagrams.
- Figma: For wireframing and prototyping the user interface.

🚀 Key Features
Efficient Resource Management: Automated inventory and fuel stock management to minimize waste.
User-Centric Design: Developed intuitive interfaces to enhance user experience.
Scalable Architecture: Designed a flexible system that can be easily adapted for future expansions.
Reporting & Analytics: Integrated reporting features to provide insights into system performance and fuel usage.

📈 Outcomes & Learning
Gained hands-on experience in applying Systems Analysis techniques to real-world problems.
Improved skills in creating detailed UML diagrams and ERDs to visualize system architecture.
Learned how to translate user requirements into a functional prototype and scalable solution.
